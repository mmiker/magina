# magina
An [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) broker library for Golang, using RabbitMQ as backend.

## WARNING
This project is under development and not production ready. Issues and contributions are wellcomed.

## Features

* support running standalone or being embed in your own application as golang library.
* based on [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com)'s stable, reliable and efficient message service.
* suport QoS 0 and 1.
* easy to scale up because of the share nothing implementation. 

## Features in the near future.

* suport QoS 2.
* suport websocket proxy.
* suport TLS/SSL.
* extend topic schema to support RPC(non-mqtt-official).

## How to use 

(package management depends on [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), install it first and run `glide install` in the projectv folder)

### standalone

the standalone borker is in ```./standalone```ï¼Œ you can build and run it as you like.

###### options:
* `-rabbit=xxx`: follw [rabbitmq uri schema](http://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html). example: `-rabbit=amqp://user:pass@host:10000/vhost`
